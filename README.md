# GPT-CRUD-API

## Overview
The **GPT-CRUD-API** is a Django-based web application that provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files. This project aims to integrate with ChatGPT, enabling it to manage files through simple commands, enhancing interactivity and automation.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on file objects through a RESTful API.
- **User-Friendly API**: Easy-to-use endpoints that accept JSON data for seamless integration with various applications.
- **Admin Interface**: Access to the Django admin panel for manual management of file objects.
- **Future Integration**: Designed to allow interaction with ChatGPT, enabling it to perform file operations autonomously.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (configurable to other databases)
- **Deployment**: Local development using Djangoâ€™s built-in server

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST Framework

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPT-CRUD-API.git
   cd GPT-CRUD-API
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install django djangorestframework
   ```
4. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Usage
- Access the API endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/files/`.
- Access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.

### API Endpoints
- **Create a File**: `POST /api/files/`
- **Read Files**: `GET /api/files/` (all files) or `GET /api/files/{id}/` (specific file)
- **Update a File**: `PUT /api/files/{id}/`
- **Delete a File**: `DELETE /api/files/{id}/`

## Future Work
- Enhance the API with additional features, such as user authentication and file upload capabilities.
- Develop a comprehensive integration with ChatGPT to handle file operations based on user commands.
